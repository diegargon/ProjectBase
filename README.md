ProjectBase 
===========
Hello and excuse my english.
I started this project for learn how to build something like a CMS from scratch, with plugins support, and other things for learning
more deeply PHP.

This code are in very early stage, have bugs, security problems and messy code. This code can change completely and probably will change. Not use it.

My mainly purpose in this project its build all pieces of a CMS separatly, each time i build one of that pieces i found problems with my general code
and sometimes i must change the general behavior. This is because i haven't experience building a CMS from scratch and i not want copy the behavior of other common 
 CMS
