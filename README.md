# ProjectBase
Hello. Excuse my english.
I started this project for learning purposes  how to build something like a CMS from scratch, with plugins support, and other things like learning
more deeply PHP.
That project have unclearly code, probably bad code, and security flaws, i will rebuild part of this code as time goes on and learn more.

My mainly purpose in this project its build all pieces of a CMS separatly, each time i build one of that pieces i found problems with my general code
and sometimes must change the general behavior. This is because i haven't experience building a CMS from scratch and i not want copy the behavior of other common 
 CMS


Early example  http://envigo.net/ProjectBase (sometimes not work since its the production web)
